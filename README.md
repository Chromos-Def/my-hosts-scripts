My hosts script

# How to use
- The script will update from the sources I listed below and combine all of them into a single file named **HOSTS**.
- You will need to manually drag the **HOSTS** file into the proper directory.
     - That directory being **C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc**
- Recommended to apply **DNS_Cache_Tweak.reg** if you **do not** disable your *DNS Client* service.
# TO DO
- Have the script install the HOSTS file into the proper location
- Write up a better README
